# Smart Markdown Pro

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work%20in%20progress-yellow)

An intelligent, local-first markdown editor with AI-powered formatting, built for focus and flow.

## The Concept

Smart Markdown Pro is a modern web-based markdown editor designed for developers, writers, and content creators. It aims to solve two common frustrations: the lack of visual customization in preview panes and the tediousness of manually formatting text.

The core of the application is a classic side-by-side editor with a real-time preview, but its standout feature is an AI assistant that can instantly convert unstructured text into clean, well-formatted markdown. All documents are stored directly in your browser's local storage for ultimate speed and privacy.

The initial version of the project is focused on delivering these key features:

* ‚úçÔ∏è **Dual-Pane Editor:** A real-time, resizable markdown editor and preview pane.
* üíæ **Local-First Storage:** All work is automatically saved to your browser's `localStorage`. No account needed.
* ü§ñ **AI-Powered Formatting:** A one-click button to format your entire document using AI, turning messy notes into structured markdown.

## Tech Stack

This project is being built with a modern, performant, and type-safe stack:

* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
