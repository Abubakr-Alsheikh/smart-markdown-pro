## üöÄ Future Vision & Roadmap (Phase 3)

While the current application is a powerful tool, there is a clear path for future growth. The following "nice-to-have" features are planned for future development, contingent on user demand and feedback.

#### 1. **User Accounts & Cloud Sync**

* **Goal:** Allow users to access and edit their documents across multiple devices.
* **Implementation:**
  * Integrate user authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js).
  * Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL with Prisma, or a BaaS like Supabase/Firebase).
  * Create a full CRUD API for syncing documents to the cloud.
  * Refactor data fetching from local storage to use SWR with the new cloud API.

#### 2. **Advanced AI Actions**

* **Goal:** Expand the AI's role beyond simple formatting.
* **Implementation:**
  * Add a dropdown menu of AI actions next to the "Format" button.
  * Implement new backend prompts for actions like "Improve Writing," "Fix Grammar & Spelling," "Summarize Text," or "Translate."

#### 3. **Custom CSS & Themes**

* **Goal:** Give power users ultimate control over the preview's appearance.
* **Implementation:**
  * Add a "Custom CSS" tab in the settings modal with a code editor.
  * Allow users to save their entire customization setup (font, size, colors, custom CSS) as a "Theme" that they can name and switch between.

#### 4. **Presentation Mode**

* **Goal:** Turn markdown documents into simple, elegant presentations.
* **Implementation:**
  * Integrate a presentation library like Reveal.js.
  * Add a "Present" button that interprets markdown separators (e.g., `---`) as slide breaks and launches a full-screen presentation view.
